Advantages
* Few requirements, the setup is easy and can be executed at different levels of cutomizations depending on the requirements of the tester.
* Gives unbiased test cases.
* Is extremely fast and immensely reduces the workload of the tester, by doing most of the grunt work for him.
* By using randoop we got a full regression test suite without putting in manaul effort.

Diadvantages
* The tests generated are unmaintainable. Even running for a short amount of time can produces >100000 lines of tests and each test methos might be 200 lines long.
* Use of random functions result in generation of flaky tests.
* It can't find deep errors or it never can generate a perfect test suite, manual work is necessary.
* Randoop is not intelligent, and produces many similar test cases.
